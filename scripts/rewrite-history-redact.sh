# rewrite-history-redact.sh — one-shot git history scrubber for leaked secrets.
#
# Designed for the case where a credential was committed and pushed to
# `origin/main`, then deleted in a follow-up commit. The deletion does NOT
# remove the value from history; this script does.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/rewrite-history-redact.sh <redactions-file> <empty-work-dir>
#   bash scripts/rewrite-history-redact.sh --help
#
# Arguments:
#   <redactions-file>   Absolute path to a `git filter-repo --replace-text`
#                       expressions file. Must NOT live inside any clone of
#                       this repo (the script refuses paths under
#                       /Volumes/docker/dockge or /volume1/docker/dockge).
#                       Recommended location: /tmp/dockge-redactions.txt
#                       Format (one entry per line, literal substring):
#                         <secret-value>==>REDACTED_PLACEHOLDER
#                       Example (never commit real values):
#                         YOUR_SUBSTRING_HERE==>REDACTED_PLACEHOLDER
#
#   <empty-work-dir>    Absolute path to an empty (or non-existent) working
#                       directory. The script does ALL of its work here so
#                       your live `/Volumes/docker/dockge` and the NAS clone
#                       at `/volume1/docker/dockge` are never touched.
#                       Recommended: /tmp/dockge-history-rewrite
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - `git-filter-repo` installed and on PATH.
#       macOS:   brew install git-filter-repo
#       Linux:   pipx install git-filter-repo  (or distro package)
#   - The leaked credential has ALREADY BEEN ROTATED at every place that
#     trusted it. History rewrite alone cannot un-leak a value that was
#     ever pushed to a public remote — assume scrapers and forks already
#     have it.
#   - You are running this from a machine that has a clean workspace
#     OUTSIDE both `/Volumes/docker/dockge` and `/volume1/docker/dockge`.
#     The script will clone the remote fresh into <empty-work-dir>.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Validates inputs and toolchain.
#   2. `git clone --mirror git@github.com:ofayese/dockge-ots.git`
#      into <empty-work-dir>/dockge-ots.git
#   3. Sanity-checks that at least one source pattern from the redactions
#      file is currently reachable somewhere in history.
#   4. Runs `git filter-repo --replace-text <redactions-file>`.
#   5. Re-checks that NO source pattern remains anywhere in history.
#   6. Prints, but does NOT execute, the exact `git push --force-with-lease`
#      command and the post-push recovery procedure.
#
# What this script deliberately does NOT do:
#   - It does NOT force-push. You force-push only after reviewing the diff.
#   - It does NOT mutate your active workspace clone or the NAS clone.
#     After force-push, both must be re-cloned (their old history is gone).
#   - It does NOT delete the redactions file. After a successful rewrite,
#     securely remove it yourself:
#         macOS:  rm -P <redactions-file>
#         Linux:  shred -u <redactions-file>

rewrite-history-redact: missing arguments — pass exactly two paths.

  bash scripts/rewrite-history-redact.sh <absolute-redactions-file> <absolute-empty-work-dir>

Both paths must be OUTSIDE this repo (not under /volume1/docker/dockge or /Volumes/docker/dockge).

Example on DSM / Linux (creates /tmp redactions file with one literal substring to replace):

  printf '%s\n' 'YOUR_SECRET_SUBSTRING==>REDACTED_PLACEHOLDER' >/tmp/dockge-redactions.txt
  bash scripts/rewrite-history-redact.sh /tmp/dockge-redactions.txt /tmp/dockge-history-rewrite

Use your real leaked substring on the left of ==> (never commit it). Prefer running as your normal
user so SSH keys work for git@github.com; sudo runs as root and often breaks clone auth.

NEXT STEPS — review, then execute these manually:

  1. Inspect the rewritten history (optional but recommended):
       cd $MIRROR_DIR
       git log --oneline -n 20
       git show <suspect-commit> -- stacks/code-server/config/code-server/config.yaml || true

  2. Restore the origin remote and force-push the rewritten refs.
     filter-repo strips remotes by design; add it back here:
       cd $MIRROR_DIR
       git remote add origin $REMOTE_URL
       git push --force-with-lease --mirror origin

     --mirror pushes ALL refs (branches AND tags). If you want to be
     more conservative, push branches one at a time instead.

  3. After force-push succeeds, every existing clone has stale history.
     Re-clone the workspace and the NAS:

       # Local workspace (macOS):
       cd /Volumes/docker
       mv dockge dockge.pre-rewrite.\$(date +%Y%m%d)
       git clone $REMOTE_URL dockge

       # NAS (over SSH):
       ssh laolufayese@10.0.1.15 -p 28
       cd /volume1/docker
       sudo mv dockge dockge.pre-rewrite.\$(date +%Y%m%d)
       sudo git clone $REMOTE_URL dockge
       sudo bash dockge/scripts/init-nas.sh

  4. Open PRs / branches that contained the rewritten commits will need
     to be rebased onto the new history (or closed and re-opened).
     GitHub may also keep the old commits visible via direct SHA URLs
     for some time — they are unreachable from refs but cached.

  5. Securely delete your local redactions file:
       macOS:  rm -P $REDACTIONS_FILE
       Linux:  shred -u $REDACTIONS_FILE

  6. Treat the original credential as permanently compromised (it has
     been public on GitHub since the original push). Confirm rotation
     was actually applied wherever it was used.
